# Power-BI-Dashboard-Project-2
In this project I Help an organization to improve employee retention
(reduce attrition) by creating an HR Analytics dashboard.

Orchestrated the development of an HR Analytics dashboard aimed at enhancing employee retention and diminishing attrition rates within the organization. Leveraged data insights to identify retention trends, analyze factors contributing to turnover, and formulate targeted strategies. Facilitated informed decision-making to foster a more stable and engaged workforce.

● Firstly, the insert filter is for different departments. We can see particular departments, with the help of card
visuals we can see exact values of employee count of employees, attrition, attrition rate, avg age, avg salary,
age years.

● Using visualizations like Donut chart ( attrition by education, employees from which education background are
leaving the company more ). Stacked column chart ( attrition by age, how many employees and in which group
of age are leaving the company ). Matrix ( what are the job roles available in the company and how many
employees work in each department ). Area chart ( attrition by years at company, count of employees leaving
company in which durations of years ).stacked bar chart ( attrition by salary slab, count of employees leaving
company in which group of category salary ). ( attrition by job role, in which type of job role employees leave the
company ). Treemap (attrition by gender, which gender leaves the most ).

● In the HR Analytic Dashboard we can analyze the situation of the company and find the reason for employee
attrition.
